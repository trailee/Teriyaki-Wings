Narrator: You have gotten the good ending
Narrator: Desdemona was an "attractor" and the goal for her is to get everyone on the ship to "The Circus and Attractions" where they become either the attractions or experimented zorens.
Narrator: But remember just because you're free doesn't mean you'll be save for long. At the end this is just a momentary relieve.
Narrator: Everything will end in some way. Just like this game.
=> END
