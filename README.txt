PROJECT NAME AND USE
The game Mission: Survive is about a character name Desdemona and her friends journey to "The Circus & Attractions". 
In this post apocalypse world, "The Circus & Attractions" is known to be the first safe place from zorens (hybrid of zombies and sirens). 
"The Circus & Attractions" has been sending out cruise ship all over the world to rescue survivors. In this game, players will have to experience two days & two nights of terror and mystery to make it to the safe haven.

REASON FOR PROJECT
This project was created for an international game jam designed to empower girls and non-binary youth. 
We got inspiration from mythologies such as Greek and other tales of the past, and by general classical literature.

PROJECT CREATION
Mission: Survive was created using the Godot game engine. 
The character art was drawn using Pixilart and ibisPaint (mobile). 
For organization, our team used Google docs to write the story line script. 
We mainly communicated on Discord to make sure we were all on the same page to improve efficiency and prevent miscommunication. 
The background music was all made on GarageBand (macOS)

STRUGGLES AND LEARNINGS
We learned game development was not as easy as we thought it was. As it was all of our first time's creating a game, we had high expectations on our game's final result.
Along the way, we had to learn to prioritize specific parts of the game, noticing there was not enough time to carry on with our initial plan.
In addition, we also learned how to communicate with one another more effectively. As some of us are from different time zones, communication was a bit rocky. 
We solved this issue by personally messaging those in a different time zone and setting goals for one another to ensure everyone was on the same track.
Furthermore, our grasp on game development had improved, where we all learned about game scenes and mechanics. 
As it was our first time trying out game development, this experience had significantly expanded our knowledge in coding and game development overall.
Special thanks to Brackeys, GDQuest, and Nathan Hoad on Youtube for helping guide us through these tough times!
